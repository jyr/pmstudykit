              <li><strong>Knowledge, performance, and personal skills</strong> are the three areas that project managers focus on to get better at their jobs.</li>
              <li>A <strong>project charter</strong> is a document that describes a project’s requirements and high-level schedule, assigns a project manager, and authorizes the project.</li>
              <li>A <strong>program</strong> is a collection of projects that should be managed together in order to achieve a specific goal or benefit to the company.</li>
              <li>A <strong>portfolio</strong> is a collection of projects or programs.</li>
              <li>A <strong>project</strong> gathers a team together to do work that’s <strong>temporary</strong>, creates a <strong>unique result</strong>, and is <strong>progressively</strong> elaborated.</li>
              <li>An <strong>operation</strong> (or process) is work that’s done in a way that’s repeatable and ongoing, but is not a project.</li>                  </ol>

                    <li>If a question on the exam doesn’t state an organization type, assume it’s referring to a matrix organization. That means the PM is responsible for making budgets, assigning tasks to resources, and resolving conflicts.</li>

                    <li>A project expediter keeps track of project status only. A project coordinator has some authority, and usually reports to someone higher up in the company.

                <li><strong>The project charter</strong> officially sanctions the project. Without a charter, the project cannot begin.</li>
                <p class="text-green">NOTE<br/>
                In matrix organizations, your team doesn’t report to you, so the charter gives you the authority to put them to work.</p>
                <li>The <strong>sponsor</strong> is the person (or people) responsible for paying for the project and is part of all important project decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Develop Project Charter</strong> is the very first process performed in a project.</li>
                <li>The project charter gives the project manager authority to <strong>do the project work</strong>, and to <strong>assign work</strong> or take control of project resources for the duration of the project. It also gives the project manager authority to <strong>spend money</strong> and use <strong>other company resources</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitation techniques</strong> (like brainstorming) are ways to get all of your stakeholders on the same page about your project goals and your approach to meeting them.</li>
                <li>The <strong>business case</strong> tells everyone why the company should do the project. It’s an input to building the project charter that tells everyone that the project actually started, explains what it’s going to deliver, and authorizes the project manager to do the work.</li>
                <p class="text-green">NOTE<br/>
                The project charter shouldn’t be too detailed. You shouldn’t have to update the charter every time you change something about your project for it to stay accurate.</p>

                <li>The project charter does not include details about what will be produced or how. Instead, it contains the <strong>summary milestone schedule</strong>.</li>
                <li>Two additional inputs to Develop Project Charter are the <strong>agreements</strong> and the <strong>statement of work</strong>. The contract is what you agreed to do, although not all projects have a contract. The statement of work lists all of the <strong>deliverables</strong> that you and your team need to produce.</li>
                  <p class="text-green">NOTE<br/>
                  Agreements are sometimes referred to as contracts on the exam.</p>
                <li><strong>Enterprise environmental factors</strong> tell you how your company does business. An important one is the project <strong>management information system</strong>, which determines how work is assigned, and makes sure that tasks are done in the right order.</li>
                <li><strong>Organizational process assets</strong> tell you how your company normally runs projects. One of the most important assets is <strong>lessons learned</strong>, which is where you write down all of the valuable historical information that you learn throughout the project to be used later.</li>                
                <li>Remember that the Project Management plan is formal—which means that it’s <strong>written down</strong> and <strong>distributed</strong> to your team.</li>
                <li>You may get a question on the exam that asks what to do when you encounter a change. You <strong>always</strong> begin dealing with change by <strong>consulting the Project Management plan.</strong></li>
                <li>The <strong>project management information</strong> system is a part of your company’s enterprise environmental factors, and it’s generally part of any change control system. It defines how <strong>work is assigned to people</strong>.</li>
                <li>The Project Management plan includes <strong>baselines</strong>: snapshots of the scope, schedule, and budget that you can use to keep track of them as they change.</li>

                    <li><strong>Product scope</strong> means the features and functions of the product or service being built. <strong>Project scope</strong> means the work that’s needed to build the product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functional requirements</strong> are the behavior of the product. <strong>Nonfunctional requirements</strong> are implicit expectations about the product.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scope Management</strong> is about figuring out all of the work that’s going to be needed for the project, and making sure only that work is done—and nothing else.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>Scope Management plan</strong> is created as part of the Project Management plan. It defines the process you’ll use for defining scope and managing changes to it.</li>
                    <li>You’ll need to know the <strong>order of processes</strong> for the exam. A good way to remember them is to understand how the output of one process is used as the input for another.</li>
                    <li>The<strong>Create WBS</strong> process is a really important process on the PMP exam.</li>
                    <li>You create the WBS by <strong>decomposing</strong> large work products into work packages.</li>
                    <li>To finalize the WBS, <strong>control accounts</strong> are established for the work packages.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>WBS dictionary</strong> is a description of each work package listed in the WBS.</li>
                    <li>The inputs to WBS creation are the outputs to the Define Scope and Collect Requirements processes: the requirements document and the project scope statement.</li>
                    <li>As you decompose the work, you find new information that needs to be added to the requirements document and the project scope statement. That information is treated as a change and goes through change control. Once it’s approved, it can be added into the document, and that kicks off the planning cycle again.</li>

                    <li>The <strong>critical path</strong> is the path that has the longest duration.</li>
                    <li>You should be able to figure out the number of paths in a <strong>project network diagram</strong>, and the duration of each path.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>float</strong> for an activity is the amount that its duration can slip without causing the project to be delayed. The float for any activity on the critical path is zero.</li>
                    <li>You’ll need to know how to calculate the <strong>early start, late start, early finish, and late finish</strong> for an activity in a network diagram using the forward pass and backward pass. This is the core of critical path analysis.</li>
                    <li>You may see a <strong>PDM</strong> (or <strong>activity-on-node</strong>) diagram with special nodes that have extra boxes in the corners for the ES, EF, LF, and LS.</li>
                    <li>Don’t forget that when two paths intersect, you have to decide which ES or LF value to take for the calculation in the next node. For the <strong>forward pass</strong>, use the larger value; for the <strong>backward pass</strong>, use the smaller one.</li>

                    <li><strong>Parametric estimation</strong> is used in Estimate Costs and Determine Budget.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost aggregation</strong> is rolling up costs from the work package level to the control account level so that the numbers can be followed down through the WBS hierarchy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control accounts</strong> are high-level WBS items that are used to track cost estimates. They do not represent activities or work packages. They represent the cost of the work packages and activities that appear under them in the WBS.</li>
                    <li>The main outputs of Estimate Costs are the activity cost estimate and the basis of estimates. The main outputs of Determine Budget are the cost baseline and project funding requirements.</li>
                    <li>You will get questions on the exam asking you to select between projects using <strong>net present value</strong> (NPV) or <strong>benefit cost ratio</strong> (BCR). Always choose the project with the biggest NPV or BCR!</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifecycle costing</strong> means estimating the money it will take to support your product or service when it has been released.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rough order of magnitude Estimation</strong> is estimating with very little accuracy at the beginning of a project and then refining the estimate over time. It’s got a range of –25% to +75%.</li>
                    <li>A <strong>management reserve</strong> is money set aside to cover unplanned, unexpected costs. Your project’s funding requirements need to cover both the budget in the cost baseline and the management reserve.</li>

                    <li><strong>Inspection</strong> means <strong>checking each deliverable</strong> for defects. That means checking your specs and your documentation, as well as your product, for bugs.</li>
                    <li>The better you plan the quality activities for your project, the <strong>less inspection</strong> you need.</li>
                    <li>Ishikawa diagrams help you to <strong>pinpoint the causes</strong> of defects.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>rule of seven means</strong> that any time you have seven data points in a row that fall on the same side of the mean on a control chart, you need to figure out why.</li>
                    <li>When data points fall above the upper limit or below the lower limit on a control chart, the process is out of control.</li>
                    <li>For the test, using any of the seven basic quality tools is <strong>usually</strong> a good indication that you are in the Control Quality process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ishikawa, fishbone, and cause-and-effect</strong> diagrams are all the same thing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scatter charts</strong> help you look at the <strong>relationship</strong> between two different kinds of data.</li>

                  <li>Project managers use their <strong>general management skills</strong> (“soft skills”) to motivate and lead the team.</li>
                  <li>In a matrix organization, the project manager doesn’t have <strong>legitimate</strong> power, because the team doesn’t directly report to the project manager.</li>
                  <li>The most effective forms of power are <strong>reward power</strong>, where the project manager sets up rewards and recognition for the team, and<strong> expert power</strong>, which means the team respects the project manager’s technical expertise.</li>
                  <li><strong>Referent power</strong> is power that’s based on identifying with or admiring the power holder.</li>
                  <li><strong>Punishment power</strong> is the least effective form of power. The project manager should never punish a team mem“ber in front of peers or managers!</li>
                  <li>Project managers should be familiar with modern <strong>theories of motivation and management</strong>.</li>
                  <li><strong>McGregor’s Theories X and Y </strong>state that there are poor Theory X managers who don’t trust their teams, and good Theory Y managers who do.</li>
                  <li><strong>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</strong> is the theory that says that people can’t achieve “self-actualization” (full potential) or esteem (feeling good and important) until lower needs like safety and security are met.</li>
                  <li><strong>Herzberg’s Theory</strong> says that it’s difficult to motivate people unless hygiene factors like a paycheck and job security are already in place.</li>
                  <li><strong>Expectancy Theory</strong> holds that people only respond to rewards that are tied to goals they feel they have a realistic chance of achieving.</li>
                  <li>Bruce Tuckman’s five stages of team development are forming (the team still finding their roles), <strong>storming</strong> (the team forming opinions), <strong>norming </strong>(adjusting work habits to help the team), <strong>performing</strong> (working like a well-oiled machine), and <strong>adjourning</strong> (closing down the project).</li>
                  <li><strong>Resources, schedules, and priorities</strong> cause 50% of project problems and conflicts. Personality conflicts are actually the least likely cause.</li>
                  <li>The best way to solve a problem is to <strong>confront</strong> it, which means doing your research, figuring out what’s causing the problem, and fixing it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Withdrawal</strong> happens when someone gives up and walks away from the problem, usually because he’s frustrated or disgusted. If you see a team member doing this, it’s a warning sign that something’s wrong.</li>
                  <li>Don’t be fooled by questions that make it sound like “confronting” is a bad thing. <strong>Confronting is just another word for problem solving.</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Smoothing</strong> is minimizing the problem, and it can help cool people off while you figure out how to solve it.</li>
                  <li>You should <strong>compromise only if you can’t confront the problem.</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>Forcing</strong> means making a decision by simply picking one side. It’s a really ineffective way to solve problems.</li>

                  <li>The main output of all of the Risk Management planning processes is <strong>updated project documents</strong>, and the main document that gets updated is the <strong>risk register.</strong></li>
                  <li>The first step in Risk Management is <strong>Identify Risks</strong>, where you work with the whole team to figure out what risks could affect your project.</li>
                  <li>Qualitative and quantitative analysis are all about <strong>ranking risks</strong> based on their probability and impact.</li>
                  <li>Qualitative analysis is where you take the <strong>categories</strong> in your risk plan and <strong>assign</strong> them to each of the risks that you’ve identified.</li>
                  <li>Quantitative analysis focuses on <strong>gathering numbers</strong> to help evaluate risks and <strong>making the best decisions</strong> about how to handle them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Decision tree analysis</strong> is one kind of <strong>expected monetary value</strong> analysis. It focuses on adding up all of the costs of decisions being made on a project so that you can see the overall value of risk responses.</li>
                  <li>To calculate EMV, be sure to <strong>treat all negative risks as negative numbers</strong> and all <strong>opportunities as positive ones</strong>. Then add up all of the numbers on your decision tree.</li>
                  <li>Don’t forget <strong>watchlists</strong>. They let you monitor lower-priority risks so that you can see if triggers for those risks occur and you need to treat them as higher priorities.</li>
                  <li>All of the processes in Risk Management are <strong>Planning or Monitoring and Controlling processes</strong>. There are <strong>no Executing</strong> processes here. Since the goal is to plan for risks, there is no need to focus on actually doing the work. By then, it’s too late to plan for risks.</li>
